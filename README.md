This repository holds the basic concepts to implement build and deploy an application according to the IaC (Infrastructure as Code).

## Requirements
To run this project you need 2 VMs that run as the build server and the deployment server.
You can choose whatever you want as virtualization provider AWS or any other cloud provider if you prefer to build and deploy from the cloud. If you have not such a possibility but you have an enough powerful machine, you go for local virtualization using Virtual Box or VMware.
